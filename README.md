# SCI
The SCript Interpreter or later, Sierra Creative Interpreter, (SCI), or as it later became known as, Sierra Creative Interpreter, is the scripting language created by Jeff Stephenson for Sierra On-Line, which was used between the years of 1989 to 1997. It superseded Sierra's earlier interpreter or engine, AGI, and the runtime environment for such adventure games.
